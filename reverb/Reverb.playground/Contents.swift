 # Reverb
 
 Graphs, colors and melodies mixed together as a single interactive experience.
 
 Start touching the screen!
 
 - Experiment:
    - Proximity has an effect, distance has another
    - You can destroy nodes with the black hole
    - The more nodes on the scene, greater is the reverb
    - Note that the reverb follows the graph structure
